  This demo shows how to obfuscate a yFiles for JavaFX application.
  <br>
  The obfuscation is done using yGuard, the free bytecode obfuscator that is
  available at
  <a href="https://github.com/yWorks/yGuard">github.com/yWorks/yGuard</a>.
  <br>
  Please see the yGuard documentation hosted at
  <a href="https://yworks.github.io/yGuard/">yworks.github.io/yGuard</a>
  for further information on how to configure and use yGuard.
</p>

<h2>Obfuscation</h2>

<p>
  Obfuscation changes class, field, and method names in a consistent
  but nonsensical way that does not change the functionality of the
  software but makes decompiled Java code harder to read and publicly
  available API description of the original code inapplicable to the
  obfuscated code. Obfuscation is an important step in the process
  of deploying an application in order to protect your software.
  See how to obfuscate the yFiles library.
</p>

<p>
  Since some names need to be kept at runtime in order for Java(FX)
  applications to work, yGuard provides several mechanisms to control
  the obfuscation process. In this demo, annotations are used for this.
  Please see
  <a href="https://yworks.github.io/yGuard/task_documentation.html#controlling-obfuscation-exclusion-with-annotations">Controlling obfuscation exclusion with annotations</a>
  in the yGuard documentation for further information.

<h2>The Demo Application</h2>
<p>
  A simple <code>GraphControl</code> is shown
  that has a JavaFX rectangle in the background. The rectangle
  is positioned and sized to match the content rectangle of the
  GraphControl. This is entirely done using FXML and data binding.
</p>
<h2>Things to try</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Create new nodes and see how the background rectangle resizes and repositions accordingly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pan and zoom in the GraphControl to see that the background rectangle also zooms and
    repositions accordingly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hit the "update content rectangle" button in the toolbar to manually update the
    GraphControl's content rectangle to the current graph bounds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Run the <code>show</code> ant task to inspect the obfuscation.
  </li>
</ul>
