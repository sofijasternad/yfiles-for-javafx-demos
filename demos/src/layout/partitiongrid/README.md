# Partition Grid
  

 The PartitionGrid demo application lets you experience the usage of a `PartitionGrid` for hierarchic and organic layout calculations.   

 Nodes are assigned to columns/rows by their fill/border color and the calculated PartitionGrid is visualized after a layout run to show the effect the node assignment had for the layout.
