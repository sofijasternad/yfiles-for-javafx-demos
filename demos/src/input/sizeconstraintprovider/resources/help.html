<p>
    This demo shows how resizing of nodes can be restricted.
</p>
<p>
    This is done with custom implementations of the interface <code>ISizeConstraintProvider&lt;INode&gt;</code>
    that are added to the lookup of the nodes.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Select and resize the nodes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Node Types</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <font color="#46a8d5"><b>Blue nodes</b></font> cannot shrink. Additionally, neither side can become
        larger than three times its initial size in each resizing operation.
    </li>
    <li>
        The minimum size of a <font color="#61a044"><b>green nodes</b></font> is the size of its labels. It gets
        never smaller than that.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <font color="#ff6c00"><b>orange node</b></font> must always encompass the black rectangle.
        Additionally, it has predefined minimum and maximum sizes.
    </li>
</ul>
